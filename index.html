She will lead a series of mindfulness activities helping you to reflect and meditate. It doesn’t matter whether you are

              <p>Our retreat is small and friendly enough to ensure that each person receives individual attention and guidance. The hosts are friendly and relaxed and ready to tailor the retreat to suit your needs.</p>
              <p>We will serve delicious home made food three times a day, all made with locally sourced ingredients. Spend your evenings unwinding in led meditation and chanting sessions, playing music, dancing or relaxing.</p>

              <p>Laura has been practising yoga since childhood. Initially she sought a practice to support her dance training but quickly yoga became an integral part of her life. The combination of her strong dance background and yoga created an awareness and sensitivity of the body and the need to protect and nurture the physical being to enhance spiritual and emotional well being.</p>
              <p>For the last four years Laura's practice has been enriched by many styles of yoga inspiring her to train and share her learning with others and feels deeply grateful to be currently training under the guidance of <a href="http://www.teachyoga.com/about_us/teachers/elena_voyce">Elena Voyce</a> in London (200 hour diploma with <a href="http://yogaalliance.org/">Yoga Alliance</a>). <img class="floating-left bordered" src="images/british_wheel_of_yoga.gif" /> This experience has given a new strength to Laura's practice through Elena's vigorous training, paying particular attention to the power of soft core and opening the body through connecting to the foundation.</p>
              <p>Laura is a Fine Art graduate of The Glasgow School of Art and achieved her qualification as a teacher from The University of Cambridge. She worked as a secondary school art teacher and enjoyed providing creative opportunities for young people until deciding that she wanted to pursue an inspired path of teaching yoga full-time.</p>
              <p>As a member of <a href="http://www.bwy.org.uk/">The British Wheel of Yoga</a> Laura teaches Hatha yoga and uses her knowledge of art and dance as well as yoga to inform her classes.</p>
              <p>Laura is about to embark on a months intensive training with <a href="http://http://www.forrestyoga.com/">Ana Forrest</a>, an internationally recognised pioneer in yoga and emotional healing.</p>

              <blockquote style="width: 300px; float:left;"><p>&#8220;The historical centre has preserved its medieval charm. The lanes are narrow and winding. The buildings have balconies, terraces and interior courtyards typical of a Mediterranean landscape. The castle, the ramparts, the doors, the wells, the clock tower, the protestant temple (dating from the 12th and 13th centuries), the church and the famous "Lézan Bridge" are all emblematic buildings, remnants of the long and rich history of Lézan. 
                They will always be of interest to locals, walkers, tourists and scholars alike, who cannot fail to be charmed by this lovely place.&#8221;</p>

              <p>Laura has been practising yoga since childhood. Initially she sought a practice to support her dance training but quickly yoga became an integral part of her life. The combination of her strong dance background and yoga created an awareness and sensitivity of the body and the need to protect and nurture the physical being to enhance spiritual and emotional well being.</p>
              <p>For the last four years Laura's practice has been enriched by many styles of yoga inspiring her to train and share her learning with others and feels deeply grateful to be currently training under the guidance of <a href="http://www.teachyoga.com/about_us/teachers/elena_voyce">Elena Voyce</a> in London. <img class="floating-left bordered" src="images/british_wheel_of_yoga.gif" /> This experience has given a new strength to Laura's practice through Elena's vigorous training, paying particular attention to the power of soft core and opening the body through connecting to the foundation.</p>
              <p>Laura is a Fine Art graduate of The Glasgow School of Art and achieved her qualification as a teacher from The University of Cambridge. She currently works as a secondary school art teacher where she enjoys providing creative opportunities for young people.</p>
              <p>As a member of <a href="http://www.bwy.org.uk/">The British Wheel of Yoga</a> Laura teaches Hatha yoga and uses her knowledge of art and dance as well as yoga to inform her classes.</p>

              <blockquote style="width: 300px; float:left;"><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&#8220;The historical centre has preserved its medieval charm. The lanes are narrow and winding. The buildings have balconies, terraces and interior courtyards typical of a Mediterranean landscape. The castle, the ramparts, the doors, the wells, the clock tower, the protestant temple (dating from the 12th and 13th centuries), the church and the famous "Lézan Bridge" are all emblematic buildings, remnants of the long and rich history of Lézan. 
                They will always be of interest to locals, walkers, tourists and scholars alike, who cannot fail to be charmed by this lovely place.&#8221;</p>
